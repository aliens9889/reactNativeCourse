# React Native Course The Practical Guide

This is a following tutorial by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller you can follow his tutorial in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/).

This project is an extension about the things I've been study with react and adding the new elements from react-native.

A difference between the original tutorial and this one is I couldn't start the project with this command
```
create-react-native-app <name_app>
```
Well actually I can the real problem was when I tried to run the project after run this command
```
npm run eject
```

After this once I tried to run on ios, it didn't work . So the other way I could find to follow the tutorial was running this command.

```
react-native init <my_app_name>
```

The difference that I noticed using this command is that it doesn't use expo app to update the project. The changes you make you have to refresh with Cmd+R (If you are using Mac) or Ctrl+R (In any other machine).

To run ios simulator the command is
```
react-native run-ios
```

And for Android
```
react-native run-android
```

But remember only can run ios in Mac, and for both cases you have to keep update Xcode and to run Android install the elements neccsary like Android Studio or just the Android Development Kit (ADK). If you follow the tutorial on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/). You will have more info about it.
